# QybMath2
 A Express&jQ Contest/Test Site Demo

Hi There!

It's been a long time since I've ever published things on my site. Now I'm introducing something that I had been working on for weeks during 9,2021~10,2021, a website powered by Express, ejs, and JQuery, with BootStrap, MathJax, etc... As It's going to be deprecated, I choose to make it opensource for now on. 

Note that all the rights for multi-media(i.e. images, etc.) resources are reserved, meaning that they're NOT expected to be used in any other project, which is part of the intellectual property right for "全员杯竞赛"(qybmath).

Since 10,2020, we QybMath(全员杯竞赛) had been working on figured out a wise way to deliver math to middle-school young generations, resulting in "全员杯第一届挑战赛", which was so amazing then, it had taken our math contest to a whole new level, saving precious time for us. The site is show as below.

There's so many defects for this site, say, unsafely interaction with the database, old technology ASP+Pure JS&CSS, but surely it is a big leap.

Then in 9,2021, following the idea came up from building up the site of my own blog, I chose to rebuild the QybMath site, using Node.js, Express, ejs, Bootstrap, and MySQL. I was under the impression that I could make the site as useful as much with these advanced coding technology, only after I have used up all the techs I have acquired, that I realized a whole refactor is in need.

This is how the second version of QybMath looks like. Functions I've achived only include:

- Register/Login/Logout/Password Reset/Identifying admin
- Problem(Question) uploading, resource uploading
- Contest Management
- Footer Articles (undone)

As JavaScript OOP is awful, structure for the project is not so well. There's even no front and back-end separation. Further works are required to get this thing worked.

This is only a toy code, not some real things, just for you to study how it is being made, hope it's useful.
